Ans 6 :
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 
Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, 
make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting language 
Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.

PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python, it is a set of guidelines for writing python codes that makes
it more readable, maintainable and helps in collaboration.

Ans 11 :
Usecases of Python
1. Web Development
2. Data science and analytics
3. AI and Ml
4. Automation and scripting
5. Internet of things
    AI and ML :-
        AI is the broad field that focuses on creating machines that can simulate human intelligence.
        AI systems are used for natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning.
        Machine learning :- ML is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

Ans 12 : Python was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer. he started developing python in 1989 and 
        Python 1.0 was released in 1991.
        Python 2.0 was released in 2000.
        Python 3.0 was released in 2008.
        Python 2.0 was officially retired in 2020 making python 3.0 as standard.

Ans 13 :

    1. NumPy used for scientific computing and Data processing.
    2. Pandas used for Data analysis and Data manupulation
    3. Matplotlib used for Data visualization
    4. Pytorch used in deep learning and neural network
    5. Scikit-learn used for Machine learning and AI

Ans 14 :
sys.version - The sys. version method returns a string that contains the version number of the 
Python interpreter installed in the system. 
steps :
